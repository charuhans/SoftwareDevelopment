Using TDD approach create a diagraming application. Your application will
have a GUI, but keep the logic test driven code separated from the GUI.

1. The application will present to the user a number of shapes like Circle,
Square, Rectangle, etc. 

2. The user can drag and drop shapes on to a diagram.

3. User can move a shape on a diagram.

4. User can delete a shape from the diagram after selecting it.

5. User can select a number of shapes and group them.

6. If a group is moved, the shapes in it move.

7. If a group is deleted, everything in it is deleted.

8. A group may contain other groups.

9. A user may ungroup a group.

10. Shapes have properties (like center and radius for a circle).

11. User can save a diagram and can open saved diagrams.




Program works (different shapes can be drawn) [10]:
All tests pass (with reasonable number of tests) [20]:
Code coverage [5]: 
Move shapes [5]:
Group shapes [5]: Make it intuitive, the user has no clue how to group. Normally we click at crop over multiple objects. If it requires holding keys,
then you have to say that.
Move a group [5]: 
Save and load diagram [10]:
Design quality [10]:
Code quality [5]: 
Able to add a new shape with no change to existing code [20]:
Able to add a new shape with a string property [5]:
